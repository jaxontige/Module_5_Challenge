# Module_5_Challenge
Corbin and I worked collaboratively on this project, as usual

We utilized mostly google, GitHub, pandas, and matplotlib documentation to help find solutions to our problems

We keep running into aggregate errors when taking averages of DF columns, so that's something I need to work on understanding a little bit more

Overall, this project was a breath of fresh air compared to last weeks
